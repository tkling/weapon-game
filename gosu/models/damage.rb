    # at least they don't make it known/obvious if enemies have similar equipables to what are available to player
    # characters. It could potentially simplify things to have element/resist/damage directly on enemies rather than
    # coming from their equipables. Then again there's a nice simplicity to players and enemies sharing the same code.
